# Zoo Architect: Spatial Survival

**Zoo Architect** is a web-based educational puzzle game designed to teach Grades 3–6 geometry concepts (Area and Perimeter) through spatial resource management. Unlike traditional math games where the board resets, this game features a persistent map, forcing players to construct complex rectilinear shapes to fit animals into an ever-crowding zoo.

## Project Overview

- **Genre:** Educational Puzzle / Simulation
	
- **Target Audience:** Ages 8–12 (Grades 3–6)
	
- **Core Mechanic:** Construction and Deconstruction of composite shapes on a persistent grid.
	

## Key Features

1. **Persistent Game Board:** Decisions made in Level 1 affect available space in Level 10.
	
2. **Drafting Mode:** A "blueprint" tool allowing students to visualize math before committing resources.
	
3. **Dynamic Constraints:** Prompts require specific Area/Perimeter combinations, often forcing irregular shape construction.
	
4. **Renovation Mechanics:** Late-game tools to move or demolish structures, teaching spatial optimization.
	

## Educational Standards

This game is designed to align with Common Core Math Standards:

- **3.MD.C.6:** Measuring area by counting unit squares.
	
- **3.MD.C.7.D:** Decomposing rectilinear figures into non-overlapping rectangles.
	
- **3.MD.D.8:** Solving real-world problems involving perimeter.
